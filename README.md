# artemis-cli
A command-line application for tutors to more productively grade programming excises on ArTEMiS

## Beta notice
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/fuck-it-ship-it.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/60-percent-of-the-time-works-every-time.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

This program is still in beta and hasn't been thoroughly tested yet, make sure your grades were actually submitted properly.

## Overview and purpose
Used for the introductory course "Praktikum Grundlagen der Programmierung"
[IN0002](https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbModHb.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=452806) at TU Munich.
The course teaches first-year students from a wide range of Computer Science related study programs
the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.

The course is facilitated on/ supported by the interactive learning tool ArTEMiS
(http://www.interactive-learning.org). ArTEMiS allows tutors to download the repositories of student's
exercises in order to grade them. **This script assists the relevant steps in the grading process.**

## First steps
1. Add your ArTEMiS credentials (username and password) into `config.yml`
   * Remember to untrack the changes to this file before redistributing: `git update-index --assume-unchanged config.yml`
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x artemis_cli`
3. Install dependencies via `pip install pyyaml argparse requests unicodecsv`

Run the script via `./artemis_cli <command>`

## IDE supported grading
Commonly, the student-assignments have to be imported into the IDE of your choice. As the command `repos` adds the tests
 to the student-assignment, the projects (now) need to be **imported as Existing Maven Project**. See below on how to 
 import assignments into Eclipse/IntelliJ:
- Eclipse: `File` -> `Import` -> `Maven` -> `Existing Maven Projects` -> `Root Directory`: `path/to/course/assignment`
- IntelliJ: `Import Project` -> `path/to/course/assignment` -> `Import project from external model` -> `Maven` -> `Tick "Search for projects recursively"` -> `Next` ... `Finish`

## Supported commands (continuously updated)
1. `repos`  Download all student repos. The exercise tests are automatically added to the student repos (and have thus to be imported as "Existing Maven Project")
2. `grade`  Grade a student individually
3. `grades` Grade all students for an assignment. A gradebook, that is generated by the `repos` command for all
students to be graded, is used. The only format for gradebook implemented as of now is YAML (.yml)
4. `results` Exports all students' results (including feedback and failed tests) to `results.csv`
See below for a detailed overview of the available commands, generated through the respective `-h/--help` flag


## Help/ summary of commands
Help to all available commands can be acquired by using the help flag (`-h` or `--help`).
The following show those help outputs. However, the most up-to-date help can be found through said flags.

Below, for example, `./artemis_cli -h` was called:
```
usage: artemis_cli [-h] [-q | -v] {repos,grade,grades,results} ...
